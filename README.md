## Industry Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis: Employment and Wages (2004‚Äì2012)

This project analyzes the impact of the 2008 housing and financial crisis on employment and wages across three major industries: **Construction**, **Finance**, and **Real Estate**.

Using publicly available data from the **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) QCEW dataset** in BigQuery, I aggregated quarterly employment and average weekly wage data from **2004 to 2012** into yearly averages. Each year is labeled based on the economic period it represents: **Pre-Crisis**, **Decline**, **Crisis**, or **Recovery**.

## Dashboard Preview

The main Tableau dashboard tracks changes in employment and wages by industry over time and highlights four distinct economic periods: **Pre-Crisis**, **Decline**, **Crisis**, and **Recovery**.

If you're using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, you can open the interactive dashboard here:
